# Assignment 3
--------------

In this homework, you will empirically study various regularization methods for neural networks, and experiment with different convolutional neural network (CNN) configurations. You should start by going through the [Deep Learning Tutorials Project](https://github.com/lisa-lab/DeepLearningTutorials), especially, [LeNet](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lenet.html). The source code provided in the Homework 3 repository is excerpted from logistic sgd.py, mlp.py, and convolutional mlp.py. 

As in the previous homework, you will be using the same street view house numbers ([SVHN](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/)) dataset. A recent investigation has achieved superior classification results on the SVHN dataset with above 95% accuracy (by using CNN with some modifications). Instead of reproducing the superior testing accuracy, our task was to explore the CNN framework from various points of view. 

As in the previous homework, a python routine called load data is provided to you for downloading and preprocessing the dataset.
