    "I tried testing the model for different types of noise ranging from 10e-2 to 10e-10. I achieved the best accuracy of 70.597290640394093% at 10e-2. Even though this is close to original output as obtained in Problem a.1, this is not what I was expecting. Adding noise to inputs generalizes the training model and improves the testing efficiency. In other words, it should reduce the overfitting of training model and improve the testing performance. The current output shows that the testing efficiency is reduced which indicates that there is correlation between training and testing data."

    "The testing acccuracy achieved is 71.6286945813 for the weight added 1e-10. I tried various noise inputs ranging from 1e-6 to 1e-10 with slight changes in the test performance. The reason of this small change in testing performance illustrates that the noise in weights didn't impact the testing performance for the smaller dataset and hence we need to have a larger dataset to test the effects of noise injection in weights. I believe there will be no or negligigble effect on the model after injecting noise into weights."

Hence, that is my choice of learning rate. I experimented with 3 different filter sizes - (3,3), (4,4) and (5,5). The test accuracies obtained are 77.276923076923083, 76.057692307692307 and 76.707692307692312 percent respectively. From this, I can conclude that the CNN performs better when the filter size is reasonably small with the best being (3,3). "

This construct of CNN is similar to the one that we have in MLPs. The variables of one layer depend on the variables of previous layer and chain rule can be applied. It is because of this similarity and relationships between multiple layers of CNN, Theano can calculate gradients of the CNN via backpropagation algorithm."
