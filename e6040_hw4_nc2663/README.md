# Assignment 4
--------------

You are asked to experiment with recurrent neural networks and input embeddings. Start by going through the [Deep Learning Tutorials Project](https://github.com/lisa-lab/DeepLearningTutorials), especially, the Theano [scan](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/library/scan.html) function and [RNN](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/rnnslu.html). The source code provided in the Homework 4 repository is excerpted from rnnslu.py. 

We used the Airline Travel Information System (ATIS) dataset. A python routine called load data is provided to you for downloading and preprocessing the dataset.

In this assignment, we experimented with different parameters like context window size, dimension of word embeddings, etc.
