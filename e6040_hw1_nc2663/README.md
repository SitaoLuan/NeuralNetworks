In this assignment, we used the [JAFFE dataset](http://www.kasrl.org/jaffe.html)

The assignment contains a script download.sh that will download and unzip the dataset.A public AMI_E6040_hw1 ami has been created with all necessary packages and patches preinstalled for solving this assignment.

In this assignment, we divided the image into different blocks and performed Principal Component Analysis(PCA). Then we reconstructed image using different number of principal components and top components.
